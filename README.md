# e-Domotica

Adds support for e-Domotica Z-Wave devices.

Note: This App was created based on the [Homey Everspring App](https://apps.athom.com/app/com.everspring) created by Ralf van Dooren. The EM6550 is a rebranded version of the Everspring AN157, hence when you have both these Apps installed on your Homey the device might be paired as either an Everspring AN157 or an e-Domotica EM6550.

### Changelog
